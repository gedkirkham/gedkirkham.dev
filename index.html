        <h2>what i love</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        design, ux, creation, creativity, exploration, development, empathy, community and love. i strive to give
        everything, and aim to leave things better than how i found them. reading is a passion, and a vital resource
        for wisdom. always looking to experience something new, and always aiming to be a better person.

      <p>
        i am not exactly sure what the intention is behind this website. is it somewhere to showcase small bits of code, 
        various parts of my life and personality? as someone who is 
        constantly changing my current interests and seeking new things, it can be hard to keep track of what i am 
        practicing. i am trying to keep a balance between life and work, but they often overlap to the detriment of myself.
        i fear that if i do not keep up to date with the latest and greatest gadgets, then i somehow fall behind, 
        but conversely, if you read too much, you never actually get to do anything purposeful.
      </p>

      <p>
        i have often tried to think about what would make me happy. overtime, my ideas have conflicted, changed and 
        morphed into different things. know thyself is a phrase that i value. if you don't know or understand what you want
        in life, how can you be happy? i often muse over what we all think is and is not 
        important. we all strive for the latest and greatest, but it is only when something difficult happens in life
        that we realise that all we previously desired was meaningless. should life be about developing my own personal 
        self and others even if that means earning less money and being less "successful"?

      <p>
        i don't like to be tied down to one thing, one route. to be self-reliant, and have freedom of movement is something 
        that i want. but how to achieve such a thing? i don't even know what freedom of movement would entail. i am not even
        sure that i would want to travel too far from my family for prolonged periods of time. i sometimes feel torn 
        between the desire to travel, and the actual physical action of travelling. sometimes the thought is easier and more 
        enjoyable than the action.

      <p>
        i like to make things. to develop things. does this mean that i should aim for a life of personal diy. small hobby
        items at the weekend, or something greater? turn it into a career. but would that then restrict my freedom of movement?
        owning a business takes time, effort, stress and risk. i aim to avoid stress but i am not sure that can be attained as a 
        web developer. as someone who has developed a large dose of imposter syndrome, i frequently feel inadequate when 
        compared against others. but none of this matters when viewed from afar, so why should i care?

      <p>
        as someone who who frequently reads, i am always gaining insight to how other people think, act and what
        they think is the right and correct thing to do. some of these ideas have previously conflicted with each other and
        has caused my mind to be caught down the middle. as someone who seeks guidance from others, this has been a 
        confusion within my mind. as i grow older, my ideas are becoming more concrete and i feel able to discern between
        what i believe in, and what i don't. i continue to read, and i hope you do as well.

      </header>
      <p>worked as a software tester for three years before taking a sideways step into the world of web
        development.
      </p>
      
      <p>as a full-stack developer, i have worked with vue.js and quasar to build both a simple spa, and complex
        translation dashboard. developed both rest and graphql api's to retrieve and post data to a sql database.
        worked
        with the django framework which required upskilling in python, and also required me to better understand crsf,
        and user authentication.</p>

        <p>as a software tester, i developed and executed test scripts for web and mobile applications. designed and
        maintained test metrics for stakeholders. maintained a test automation suite. developed proficient knowledge
        of
        xquery to execute complex queries within a nosql marklogic database to both inject and locate data.
        implemented
        complex bash scripts to be more efficient in testing.</p>
